# Languages

Only edit `ui.json`! The rest of the files are autogenerated and will be overwritten on new game updates.

## How to edit / add a new language

1. Go into your language folder (lang/en) and edit the `ui.json` file. If there is no `ui.json` file, create one.
2. You can look at other `ui.json` files to see the format.
3. The translation code will use your language first, and if it can't find the translation, it will default back to `en`.
